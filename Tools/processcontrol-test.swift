//  A force quit takes a process down without letting it save. The two ways
//  this can be wrong are both silent: reporting success for something that
//  did not happen, and sending a signal to a pid that does not mean what the
//  row said. kill(2) reads 0, -1 and any negative number as whole classes of
//  process rather than one, so the guard on those is the difference between
//  ending Chrome and ending the session.
