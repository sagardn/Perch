//  A command-line tool has no bundle identifier, so every match here is a
//  name match -- which is exactly the loose matching the app uninstaller
//  refuses to tick for anybody. The cases below are therefore about two
//  things: that a shared directory is never claimed as one tool's, and that
//  a package name is never allowed to become a shell argument.
