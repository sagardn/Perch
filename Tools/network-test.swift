//  Rates are the part of this module that can be wrong quietly. A counter
//  that went backwards, a clock that did not move, a machine that slept --
//  none of these produce an error, they produce a plausible wrong number. A
//  live network card will not reproduce them to order, so the arithmetic is
//  tested directly and the live reader is checked only for the invariants
//  that must hold on any machine.
