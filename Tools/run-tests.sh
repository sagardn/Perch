#!/bin/bash

#  run-tests.sh
#
#  Runs every assertion suite in Tools/ and fails if any assertion does.
#
#  Each suite is a standalone Swift script that is fed the app's own source
#  files on stdin, so what it checks is what ships rather than a copy. The
#  list of sources each one needs lives in that suite's own "Run:" header,
#  and this reads the command out of the header rather than keeping a second
#  list here -- a second list is a list that drifts, and the way it drifts is
#  that a suite silently stops being run.
#
#  Usage:  Tools/run-tests.sh [suite ...]
#
#  With no arguments, every Tools/*-test.swift. With arguments, just those
#  (a bare name is fine: "disk" means Tools/disk-test.swift).
#
#  A suite must print "all passed" or "<n> failed" as its last line, and exit
#  non-zero when any assertion failed. Both, not either: the exit status alone
#  cannot tell a failed assertion from a suite that never got that far. A
#  compile error, an out-of-memory kill, and a trap inside a live IOKit call
#  all exit non-zero with no assertion having failed at all, and reporting
#  those as "failed" sends the next person looking for a bug in the thing
#  being tested. The marker is what separates them, and a suite that exits
#  non-zero without printing one is reported as not having run to completion.
