//  Exercises the diagnostics report, and mostly what it must never contain.

//  Run:  cat Perch/System/SystemReport.swift Tools/report-test.swift | swift -
//
//  The report exists to be pasted into a public issue. Everything else about
//  it is a convenience; this is the part that can do harm. So the sensitive
//  fields are set to sentinels here and the whole text is searched for them,
//  rather than trusting that `report` was written carefully -- it is the next
//  edit that worries me, not this one.
