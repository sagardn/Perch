//  whether to ask about supporting it, and how often to check for a release.

//  None of these could be checked where they used to live. The first needs a
//  version transition that has already happened, the second a date a month in
//  the past, the third an idle machine -- so all three shipped on the strength
//  of somebody reading them and agreeing. They were right; that is the point
//  of writing the cases down rather than the reason for it. A downgrade not
//  announcing itself as an update, and a clock that has gone backwards not
//  counting as "ages since we last asked", are both now pinned instead of
//  being properties the next edit can quietly remove.
