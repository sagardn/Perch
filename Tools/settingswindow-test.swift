//  Names reach this from four directions -- the menu bar's gear, a hotkey, an
//  .openModuleSettings notification and AppDelegate's reopen handler -- and a
//  name that resolves wrongly shows somebody the wrong module's switches
//  under the right module's title. None of it raises an error, and the window
//  cannot be instantiated in a script, so the mapping is checked here.
