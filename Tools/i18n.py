                                   still used

Each command exits non-zero when it finds a problem, which is what CI reads.

Standard library only, so CI needs nothing but a Python. There is no
`translate` command: translations are written and reviewed as text, not
generated on every run, so a run of this script never changes what a user
reads except through `fix`, and `fix` only ever copies English in.
