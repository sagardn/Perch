//  Prints what WindowControl.windowList(for:) can see, for every running app.
//
//  A probe, not a suite: it asserts nothing, it reports. It needs a live
//  desktop and Accessibility permission, and what it prints is whatever
//  happens to be open -- which is why it is not in Tools/run-tests.sh and
//  does not carry a -test name. Named one it would have been counted as a
//  suite that passed, while checking nothing at all.
//
//  Reported as "if any app 3 windo open i can witch in2 windo in my app".
//  Electron apps publish nothing through kAXWindowsAttribute, so the Windows
//  section never appeared for them; this shows the Accessibility count beside
//  the count Perch ends up with, which is the thing that was wrong.
