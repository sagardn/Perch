//
//  Prints the screen rect of Perch's frontmost panel, for screencapture -R.
//
//  Why not screencapture -l<windowid>: capturing a window on its own returns
//  it with a transparent background, and these popups are glass -- the blur
//  they show is the desktop behind them, which a window-only capture throws
//  away. Capturing the region keeps what the eye actually sees.
//
//  Usage: swift Tools/window-shot.swift [owner]
