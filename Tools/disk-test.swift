//  Two of these are the kind of wrong that looks right. A rate taken across a
//  sleep reports a trickle that never happened, and an APFS container's
//  helper volumes each report the container's capacity with nothing free --
//  so listing them shows one disk six times, every copy apparently full.
//  Neither produces an error and neither can be reproduced to order on a
//  live machine, so both are checked here against values written down.
