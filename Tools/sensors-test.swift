//  the machine this was written on is a MacBook Air, which has no fans, so
//  no fan reading can be produced on it at all. The cases that matter -- a
//  fan at 2,400 rpm, a key reading back nonsense, a controller that answers
//  nothing -- are written down instead. The live checks assert only what must
//  hold on any Mac, and report themselves skipped where there is no
//  controller to ask: a CI runner is a virtual machine and has none.
