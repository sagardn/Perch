/// `ThresholdNotice` does not.

/// It deliberately does not share code with `ThresholdNotice`, which posts the
/// same four UserNotifications calls for CPU and memory alerts. That one is
/// compiled on its own by `Tools/threshold-test.swift` -- the suite feeds
/// `Thresholds.swift` to `swift -` and nothing else -- so a reference from
/// there to here would cost the test, and fifteen lines of UNMutableNotification
/// plumbing is a cheaper thing to have twice than a test is to lose.
