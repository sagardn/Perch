///
/// **Everything identifying is left out, by construction.** This text is
/// going into a public issue, and a diagnostics feature that leaks a serial
/// number or a home Wi-Fi name has done more harm than the bug it was
/// helping with. So the rule here is not "redact what looks sensitive" --
/// which is a judgement made freshly, and wrongly, each time something is
/// added -- it is that identifying values never enter the report at all. The
/// report says *whether* a reading answered and *how many* of a thing there
/// were, never which one.
