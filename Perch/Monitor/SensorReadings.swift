/// - **AppleSMC**, which adds the families HID has none of: voltage,
///   current and power. Reading it needs no privilege; only *writing* a key

/// transcription of undocumented firmware keys, and most of its entries
/// cannot be verified on any one machine. Perch names a sensor whatever the
/// system calls it, and from SMC exposes only the handful of keys whose
/// reading could be checked against something else -- see `knownKeys`.
