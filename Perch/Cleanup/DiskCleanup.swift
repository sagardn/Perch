/// The obvious feature here is a button that empties the Bin and clears some
/// caches. It is not built, and the reason is worth keeping: **the Bin cannot
/// be read without Full Disk Access.** `~/.Trash` is TCC-protected, so even
/// showing its size would mean asking a menu bar monitor for the broadest
/// file permission macOS has — and an app that asks for that to tidy up has
/// asked for everything, forever, to do something Finder already does with a
/// confirmation sheet.
///
/// The other half of the usual offering is worse than useless. Clearing
/// `~/Library/Caches` frees space that applications immediately rebuild,
/// slowly, while things misbehave in the meantime; deleting unused language
/// files breaks the localisation it took this app 263 keys to get right.
/// Neither is cleanup, and both are what "cleaner" apps sell.
///
/// So this points at the two places that genuinely do the work and needs no
/// permission to do it. macOS already knows what is reclaimable, which
/// snapshots it can thin and which downloads it can re-fetch; the useful act
/// is getting somebody there with the number that made them look.
