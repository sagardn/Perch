/// package manager installed is removed by **that manager's own command** --
/// deleting `Cellar/ripgrep` behind Homebrew's back leaves its receipts
/// claiming the formula is still there and its symlinks dangling. A tool
/// that is just a file somebody downloaded has no manager, so it goes to the
